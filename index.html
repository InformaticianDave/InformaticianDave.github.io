									<h2><a href="#">My name is David Liu</a></h2>
									<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Medical Informatics. As a health informatician, I am seeking better opportunities for personal and professional advancement. My long-term objective is to aggressively promote academic originality and the critical thinking skills necessary for lifelong learning. I believe it is essential for the continued advancement of patient care. To promote and strengthen the notion of leadership and professionalism within the profession and society as a whole; with regard to the cultivation and evaluation of ethical practices for future generations.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">3-D Molecular Structures with BioPython
											<br />
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/InformaticianDave/3-D-Molecular-Structures-with-BioPython" class="image fit"><img src="images/Biopython.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Biopython is a set of open-source computational implementations applicable to evolutionary and molecular biology, among other fields. Biopython, a very flexible and sophisticated platform, is used to create modules, classes, parsers, and other tools that speed and simplify biological research. Biopython enables its users to work with bioinformatics data such as FASTA. The portal also provides access to a variety of open-source databases and research tools. With the proper modules, bioinformaticians may locate sequences, make alignments, construct phylogenetic trees, evaluate the distance between nodes, and predict the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins, among other things.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Predictive Analysis on Diabetes<br />
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/InformaticianDave/Predictive-Analytics-on-Diabetes-Mellitus" class="image fit"><img src="images/diabetes.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one of the major metabolic disorders that causes the body to produce insufficient insulin or become insulin-resistant. There are two varieties of diabetes, but the one we will be focused on in this research is Type 2 diabetes, which is a hereditary disorder primarily associated with insufficient insulin production. Type II diabetes is associated with insulin resistance acquired primarily as a result of obesity and sedentary lifestyle. In recent years, it has become widespread in emerging nations, posing a higher threat to persons in the latter than in the earlier.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Predictive Analysis on Heart Failure<br />
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/InformaticianDave/Predictive-Analysis-on-Heart-Failure" class="image fit"><img src="images/heart.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) claim the lives of 17.9 million people annually. This figure represents 31 percent of the total number of fatalities that occur across the globe. This dataset comprises 12 variables that may be used to predict mortality caused by heart failure. Heart failure is a frequent occurrence that is caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The majority of cardiovascular illnesses are preventable if behavioral risk factors including smoking, poor diet and obesity, lack of physical exercise, and problematic alcohol consumption are addressed through population-wide interventions.</p>
