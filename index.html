									<h2><a href="#">My name is David Liu</a></h2>
									<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Medical Informatics. As a health informatician, I am seeking better opportunities for personal and professional advancement. My long-term objective is to aggressively promote academic originality and the critical thinking skills necessary for lifelong learning. I believe it is essential for the continued advancement of patient care. To promote and strengthen the notion of leadership and professionalism within the profession and society as a whole; with regard to the cultivation and evaluation of ethical practices for future generations.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">3-D Molecular Structures with BioPython
											<br />

									<p>Sequence analysis is extremely important, but structure ultimately determines biological function. This project's protein is responsible for removing the dopamine neurotransmitter from the synapses of neurons and terminating the feel-good effect of dopamine. This lengthy stretch of text tells us little about how it can truly accomplish this. Structural biologists are able to determine the sequence's native form within the cell. Clearly, there is a great deal of additional information encoded in the sequence that must be considered. Each structure file may contain many "models" of the identical molecule. Each model is composed of multiple "chains" or strands of protein/RNA/DNA. Each "chain" is composed of residues, also known as amino acids, DNA bases, or RNA bases. Each residue consists of atoms.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Predictive Analysis on Diabetes<br />
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/InformaticianDave/Predictive-Analytics-on-Diabetes-Mellitus" class="image fit"><img src="images/diabetes.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The random forest algorithm generates multiple decision trees and combines them to generate a more accurate and trustworthy prediction. The obtained precision is statistically significant. By dividing the data set into more understandable chunks, it is possible to identify decision boundaries. Due to the rate at which diabetes is becoming more prevalent in the population, it is essential to detect diabetes at an early stage. This study highlights the potential of machine learning for decision-making and reducing diagnostic costs in the healthcare industry. The most important contribution of this work is the creation of a unique optimal model for early diabetes forecasting, as well as the emphasis on exploratory data analysis and data processing.</p>
